        HEIRS Entertainment is our Black-owned mixed media vernacular of choice
        for pain and struggle. For our love and happiness. We had to learn to
        choose our heirlooms. Most of mine were detrimental, so I formed what I
        would manifest from my imagination, rather than what was laid before me.
        We will continue to tell our story through visuals, production, and
        fashion. Weâ€™d also love to tell yours.
        <br />
        <br />
        Love.
        <br />
